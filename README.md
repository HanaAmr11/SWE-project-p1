## Scrum Setup

- **Product Backlog**
User Registration and Authentication

User Story: As a user, I want to create an account and log in securely so I can access personalized features.
Tasks:
Set up user registration form
Implement secure login with encryption
Integrate password recovery options

Personalized Meal Planning
User Story: As a user, I want personalized meal recommendations based on my health goal.
Tasks:
Build meal recommendation engine
Display daily and weekly meal plans
  
BMI Calculation
User Story: As a user, I want to calculate my Body Mass Index (BMI) so I can assess if I am within a healthy weight range.

Tasks:
Develop a form to collect user data (height, weight, age, gender)
Implement the BMI calculation formula
Display BMI result with interpretations (e.g., underweight, normal, overweight)
Acceptance Criteria:
Users can input their height and weight and receive a BMI score.
BMI categories are displayed (e.g., underweight, healthy, overweight).
Recommendations are provided based on the BMI result.

Calorie Calculation
User Story: As a user, I want to calculate my daily calorie needs based on my personal metrics and activity level, so I can follow a diet plan aligned with my health goals.
Tasks:
Build a form to capture inputs (age, gender, weight, height, activity level, goal weight)
Implement calorie calculation using Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) formulas, adjusting for activity level
Display daily calorie needs along with breakdowns for macronutrients (e.g., protein, fats, carbs)
Integrate calorie recommendations into the meal planning feature
Acceptance Criteria:

Users can input data and select their activity level.
The system calculates and displays daily calorie needs and macronutrient breakdown.
Suggested calorie intake aligns with the userâ€™s goal (maintenance, weight loss, weight gain).

-**Sprint Plans**
Sprint 1: BMI Calculation Feature
Goal: Implement a BMI calculation tool that allows users to input personal data (height, weight, etc.) and receive their BMI and health recommendations.
Tasks:
Design UI for BMI input and results.
Implement BMI calculation logic.
Display personalized health advice based on BMI.
Perform functional testing.

Sprint 2: Calorie Calculation Feature
Goal: Implement a calorie calculation feature to help users determine their daily calorie needs based on personal data and activity level.
Tasks:
Design UI for calorie input and results.
Develop logic to calculate total daily energy expenditure (TDEE).
Integrate with BMI feature for personalized advice.
Test and validate calculations.

Sprint 3: User Profile & Personalization
Goal: Allow users to register, log in, and manage their personal profiles. Provide personalized health recommendations based on their data.
Tasks:
Implement user registration, login, and password recovery.
Set up database for user data storage (height, weight, activity level).
Display personalized health tips and diet recommendations.
Test user authentication and profile management.

Sprint 4: Meal Planning & Tracking
Goal: Enable users to track their meals and daily calorie intake to stay within their recommended limits.
Tasks:
Design meal input form with nutritional information.
Integrate food database or API for meal data.

1. Product Owner: Hana Amr
Role: Responsible for defining the product vision and ensuring the product aligns with user needs and business goals. The Product Owner prioritizes the Product Backlog to ensure the team works on the highest value features. They work closely with the Scrum Master and the Development Team to make sure the project stays aligned with the vision and goals.
2. Scrum Master: Nada Mohamed 
Role: Facilitates the Scrum process, ensuring that the Scrum framework is being followed. The Scrum Master removes impediments, helps organize Scrum ceremonies (such as Sprint Planning, Daily Standups, Sprint Reviews, and Sprint Retrospectives), and ensures that the team adheres to Scrum practices. The Scrum Master acts as a coach for the team and helps improve team performance.
3. Development Team:
Farah Mostafa

Role: Responsible for building the product increment. This team member works on developing features such as the BMI calculation and calories calculation functions. They collaborate with the rest of the team and ensure tasks are completed within the sprint.

Youssef Ahmed

Role: Focuses on coding and implementation of the system's features and modules. They collaborate with other team members on the BMI calculation module, ensuring that the code follows quality standards, is well-documented, and integrates well with the entire system.
Nada Mohamed

Role: Responsible for designing and testing features, ensuring the code quality is maintained. They are involved in the testing of the BMI calculation and calories calculation functionalities and work on fixing bugs, optimizing code, and improving the overall quality of the system.

**Scrum Events**
Sprint Planning:

Sprint Planning is the first event in the sprint. The team meets to discuss which tasks and user stories will be worked on in the upcoming sprint. The goal is to set clear objectives and prioritize work.
Example: "Sprint 1 will focus on developing the BMI calculation module and Sprint 2 will work on the calorie calculation feature."

Daily Standups:

Daily Standups are short, time-boxed meetings (typically 15 minutes) where each team member provides an update on their progress, shares what they plan to work on next, and highlights any blockers they might be facing.
Example: "Team members are expected to provide updates on their tasks during daily standups (15-minute meetings)."

Sprint Reviews:

At the end of each sprint, the team holds a Sprint Review meeting to demonstrate the work completed, gather feedback from stakeholders, and discuss any necessary adjustments. This helps ensure that the team is on track to meet the project goals.
Example: "At the end of each sprint, a Sprint Review meeting will be held to assess progress and adjust priorities."

Sprint Retrospectives:

Sprint Retrospectives are held at the end of each sprint to reflect on the process, discuss what went well, what could be improved, and identify action items for the next sprint. This continuous improvement cycle ensures the team adapts and improves over time.
Example: "Sprint Retrospectives will be used to discuss what went well, what can be improved, and action items for the next sprint."
